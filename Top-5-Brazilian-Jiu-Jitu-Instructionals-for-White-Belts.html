<h1>THE SCIENCE OF JIU-JITSU SERIES 1 - STARRING DEMIAN MAIA, 6 VOLUMES ON 6 DVD'S</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SCIENCE-JIU-JITSU-STARRING-DEMIAN-VOLUMES/dp/B001D8V1D8/ref="><img alt="MainProductImage" src="./images/THESCIENCEOFJIUJITS.jpg" title="Check our latest prices"></a></p>
<p>This has been proven to be invaluable over and over again. Has become one of my favorite sets of bjj instructionals. As Demian teaches each submission counter escape and more he exposes where these hidden techniques exist and how to use them with maximum effectiveness.. I really like the way he demonstrates every technique!Lots of techniques to learn. This will give you a whole new set of grappling tools that you can pull from at all times to gain more strength and better positioning. By exposing these overlooked and long forgotten concepts Science of JiuJitsu will make you rethink your current grappling game and give you a completely new outlook on the art of JiuJitsu. Demian Maia is indeed the best JiuJitsu fighter there is!Focused on only a couple positions.good product fast deliveryI cant say how much I love this series of instructional tapes. </p>
<p>Everything included in this set will be immedilately applicable. He covers everything from different angles almost as good as being in a BJJ class with him and is a great supplement as things you may not remember from class he definitely goes over in detail and covers. Demian Maia Brazilian JiuJitsu and ADCC Champion blows the roof off traditional instructional methods by revealing how the concepts of leverage and body mechanics can be used to gain an incredible advantage over your opponents. I worry that he may have exposed some of his game since he is still a UFC fighter but what a great set of directions he gives and covers. Once learned the unique thing about these principals is that you will be able to use them from all positions in JiuJitsu. The Science of JiuJitsu is the amazing next step in the evolution of JiuJitsu instructional DVDs. Do yourself a favor...by this one!This guy is a great martial arts teacher! </p>
<p>Ok guys no lie this is amoung the best. Recently began training in Koryu Uchinadi dojo under Sensei Pat McCarthy.Despite patient and obviously worldclass instructioni am a slow learner and there is only so much time a teacher can spend with any one student so the groundwork newazahas really caused me grief...Maias DVDset is a HUGE help...compulsory.The really impressive thing is that he speaks to entry level beginners and advanced rollers at the same time. Im still new to the sport but it helps a lot.As I wrote about the Science of JiuJitsu 2 set I also purchasedthis is a key set to buy if you want to learn the Concepts of BJJ from one of the MastersReally worth buying the whole DVD set! Really improved my fight skills! </p>
<p>I own hundreds of BJJ DVDs and the production quality bar for the industry is set very low. This is a proven set and highly regarded in the community. </p>

<h1>Ryan Hall - The Defensive Guard DVD Series</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ryan-Hall-Defensive-Guard-DVD/dp/B00PWNRZYE/ref="><img alt="MainProductImage" src="./images/RyanHallTheDefensiveGuardDVDSeries.jpg" title="Check our latest prices"></a></p>
<p>Straightforward easy to follow and professional At a few points Professor Ryan gets excited about a follow up technique that is outside of the scope of this series and he kind of leaves you hanging but probably for good reason  he keeps the topics onpoint and keeps you from being distracted by flashy ninja rolls and transitions that are covered in other DVDs.I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and sparring partner and I can already see that it was a big mistake. This DVD set spans over 5 hours of video with 53 incredible Defensive Guard techniques shown in the same methodical teaching style that has made Ryan Halls previous JiuJitsu DVD sets world famous! The content is primarily conceptual and clearly and cleverly conveys the fundamental principles underlying all sound and successful guards. Ryan teaches the when and how and why to every defensive wall you can use regardless of what position you find yourself in and all of the offensive and defensive options needed to finish the fight! This is another World Martial Arts exclusive!. Theory. </p>
<p>Ive personally seen just about every instructional video but this one has set a new standard. I only wish the series was a little longer. World Martial Arts presents Ryan Halls Defensive Guard possibly the most groundbreaking JiuJitsu series ever released! The manner in which these principles are conveyed also makes it super easy to recognise them in various positions and situations...Rather than understanding this guard or that guard Im starting to see the fundamental principles of all guards and my guard game has become more fluid and efficient. Additionally Ryan teaches within each individual guard wall position how to move unbalance and attack your opponent with sweeps turnovers and submissions. Using this strategy Ryan teaches that the sum of multiple guard walls is far greater then the whole and if an opponent is able to defeat one wall you simply fall back to the next defensive wall and effectively continue the battle. Ryan goes over a lot of core concepts that personally I needed refinement on. </p>
<p>This provides a wealth of material that will continue to refine your game. After watching this set multiple times I have become an unabashed Ryan Hall fangirl. Ryan Halls Defensive Guard concept is unlike anything you have seen beforebecause it views the guard as a position with multiple defensive walls with each wall having its own set of tactics for defending and counter fighting. He breaks it down to where anyone can understand whats happening which in this case is the guard and how you need to build walls and different layers of defense..Do your self a favor and buy it!Love itThis dude is awesome. Also World Martial Arts is great. </p>
<p>Your game will become powerful and unstopable. This video gets top marks from me for its content organization and format. But with the new knowledge hes gained from this video its now damnnear impossible for me to pass his guard. Well done bro.Exactly what I was looking for! </p>
<p>He does a great job at explaining the biomechanics behind each frame and how to use frames and posture to build and maintain the structural integrity of your walls. But hes thrilled with it.I am not getting paid for writing this review..That being said this dvd open my eyes on what my guard was lacking..Ryans teaching skills are awesome. </p>
