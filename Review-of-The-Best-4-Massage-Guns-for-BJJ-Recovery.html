      <h1>TimTam PowerMassager™ Pro – Handheld Percussion Massager – Deep Tissue Muscle Recovery Gun – Personal Therapy Massaging - Delivers Up to 2,800 Strokes Per Minute - 2X Battery Life</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TimTam-PowerMassagerTM-Pro-Percussion-Massaging/dp/B081S3DFTR/ref="><img alt="MainProductImage" src="./images/TimTamPowerMassagerProHandheldPercussionMassagerDeepTissueMuscleRecoveryGunPersonalTherapyMassagingDeliversUpto2800StrokesPerMinute2XBatteryLife.jpg" title="Check our latest prices"></a></p>
<p>This product will really shorten your recovery time. I do love the power it has and the three power levels. Even on a daytoday basis it makes me feel better. Ive heard about TimTam a couple of times on Joe Rogan and when I heard about the idea that this now had heat I was all in. </p>
<p>This massage gun has a targeted heat featuer which is really great for targeted deep tissue massage. It vibrates 2800 times per minute which can loosen up the tightest of muscles. The battery life was suprising good too and during my testing lasted about an hour. I dont think i'd ever have to use it that long, but its good to know the power wont fade quickly. </p>
<p>The other thing that i love about this product is that the arm is articulating. Which means that it rotate quite far to allow you to perform a solo massage on difficult to reach places. I occassionaly have lower back pain and being able to target the exact location of discomfort myself is important. </p>
<p>This massager is also much quieter than previous versions. Other brands were much louder and distracting. This model can be used anywhere. This is a really great product that will drastically speed up recovery time. You will instantly see results when incorporating this in your recovery program. </p>

<h1>Theragun Elite - All-New 4th Generation Percussive Therapy Deep Tissue Muscle Treatment Massage Gun…</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theragun-Elite-Generation-Percussive-Treatment/dp/B086Z6XSW4/ref="><img alt="MainProductImage" src="./images/TheragunEliteAllNew4thGenerationPercussiveTherapyDeepTissueMuscleTreatmentMassageGun.jpg" title="Check our latest prices"></a></p>
<p>This is one of the best products on the market. Ive been using it every day for workouts and after working a long day at my desk at home. As our Therabody app continues to interact with and learn from your behaviors and preferences it will suggest customized treatments to support the things you enjoy doing most.. In short I would be hurtin without my theragun. All it takes is a quick 30 second sweep to activate the body before a workout or over your shoulders after a long day to release tension and stress....Powerful deep muscle treatment..When our founder Dr. Jason Wersland searched for a natural solution for his pain the devices he tried didnt get to the root of his discomfort. 13 versions later the Elite delivers our 60 deeper amplitude and speed with up to 40 lbs. And although the vertiball is nice on my back the Theragun is nice everywhere...I use mine practically every day. </p>
<p>Now we use it all the time on any sore or tight muscle and its almost instantly better! force without stalling   powerful potent dose for greater circulation and tension release....A truly personalized wellness routine..Bluetooth enabled and seamlessly integrated with our new newly updated fullypersonalized app experience Elite is connected to your life in a more meaningful way than ever. The battery life is great we will use it for several days consistently for several hours and it will still have a charge.  </p>
<p>They were gracious enough to send me a complimentary roller and a dual tip head.This thing is a life saver! Recover...Depth speed and force are key to any deep muscle treatment but Theragun impacts muscle with a targeted scientifically calibrated dose for greater therapeutic benefits for the body. But pushing it down helps a ton so it feels more like a massage. .. Im a 60 year old woman and I fractured my neck YEARS ago and have had back issues for 10 years. </p>
<p>ts incredibly easy to use which is helpful. Its really relaxing and can immediately feel my range of movement improved after using it.This has been a life changing purchase for me. As an avid BJJ practicitioner Ive always been told about the benefits of percussive therapy and many talked about what a quality product Theragun is and so I finally caved and got one for myself and I am SO impressed! </p>
<p>Id highly recommend it to anyone.Massage guns seem to be the latest FAD in fitness with so many products flooded all over amazon from brands Ive never even heard of. I got the G3PRO last year and it did not disappoint. </p>

<p>Professional athletes have been spotted using percussive massagetherapy devices...FIND THE RELIEF YOU NEED  Sore muscles chronic tightness in your hamstrings compression damage tendon strains and inflammation can make life uncomfortable. However I deal with a lot of daily pain in my legs from years of being athletic and then being injured during my most active years.

It comes with the wall charger for it and it arrive charged. </p>
<p>The community has really embraced these massage guns because of its proven ability to help you recover faster. I pulled out the massage gun and used it on the same spot and the difference was incredible! No need to change batteries... Powerful Percussion Massage Tool  3200 rpm percussion motor 2053 rps.. Ergonomic Design  Fullbody reach multiple handling positions with an adjustable arm... Customize Your Massage  4 intensities 5 interchangeable heads.. Gift Ready Packaging and Travel Case Included. Truly much better than any previous massagers Ive used. As the foam mallet smacks down on your sore muscles youll actually feel dramatic relief. All the lights work to filter through speeds but it just wont turn back on.Problem As you press the touch pad to get the action started all too often 50 of the times the tips installed pop out and is slung across the room. </p>
<p>This is top of the line. It comes with a few different heads and trust me on this USE them. I am not sure how the product will hold with extended usage...Pros.Rotation arm makes it easy to massage the back.Comfortable silicone heads.Somewhat ergonomic design..Cons.Massage heads can be difficult to detach.Massage arm gets warm after a few minute of use. My battery indicator switches from white to red in a matter of seconds and then the device is out of battery...I tried another the SonicX massage gun before purchasing this one. </p>
<p>The pointed head really gets into targeted spots and is fabulous for small pain spots. If this is not corrected I will have to send it back as much as I hate to do so. I decided to purchase this one after seeing that it has a rotation arm. </p>
