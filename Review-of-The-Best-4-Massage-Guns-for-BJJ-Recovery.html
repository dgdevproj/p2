</li>
</ul>
<p>This product will really shorten your recovery time. I really love the power it has and the three power levels. I use it on a day today basis and it makes me feel better and keeps my muscles loose. </p>
<p>This massage gun has a targeted heat feature which is really great for targeted deep tissue massage. It vibrates 2800 times per minute which can loosen up the tightest of muscles. The battery life was suprising good too and during my testing lasted about an hour. I dont think i'd ever have to use it that long, but its good to know the power wont fade quickly. </p>
<p>The other thing that i love about this product is that the arm is articulating. Which means that it rotate quite far to allow you to perform a solo massage on difficult to reach places. I occassionaly have lower back pain and being able to target the exact location of discomfort myself is important. </p>
<p>This massager is also much quieter than previous versions. Other brands were much louder and distracting. This model can be used anywhere. This is a really great product that will drastically speed up recovery time. You will instantly see results when incorporating this in your recovery program. </p>

<p>This is one of the best products on the market. Ive been using it every day for workouts and after working a long day at my desk at home. As our Therabody app continues to interact with and learn from your behaviors and preferences it will suggest customized treatments to support the things you enjoy doing most.. In short I would be hurtin without my theragun. All it takes is a quick 30 second sweep to activate the body before a workout or over your shoulders after a long day to release tension and stress....Powerful deep muscle treatment..When our founder Dr. Jason Wersland searched for a natural solution for his pain the devices he tried didnt get to the root of his discomfort. 13 versions later the Elite delivers our 60 deeper amplitude and speed with up to 40 lbs. And although the vertiball is nice on my back the Theragun is nice everywhere...I use mine practically every day. </p>
<p>Now we use it all the time on any sore or tight muscle and its almost instantly better! force without stalling powerful potent dose for greater circulation and tension release....A truly personalized wellness routine..Bluetooth enabled and seamlessly integrated with our new newly updated fullypersonalized app experience Elite is connected to your life in a more meaningful way than ever. The battery life is great we will use it for several days consistently for several hours and it will still have a charge.  </p>
<p>They were gracious enough to send me a complimentary roller and a dual tip head.This thing is a life saver! Recover...Depth speed and force are key to any deep muscle treatment but Theragun impacts muscle with a targeted scientifically calibrated dose for greater therapeutic benefits for the body. But pushing it down helps a ton so it feels more like a massage.</p>
<p>It's incredibly easy to use which is helpful. Its really relaxing and can immediately feel my range of movement improved after using it. This has been a life changing purchase for me. As an avid BJJ practicitioner Ive always been told about the benefits of percussive therapy and many talked about what a quality product Theragun is and so I finally caved and got one for myself and I am SO impressed! </p>
<p>Id highly recommend it to anyone. Massage guns seem to be the latest FAD in fitness with so many products flooded all over amazon from brands Ive never even heard of. I got the G3PRO last year and it did not disappoint. </p>

<p>Im a serious bjj practicioner and I use this massager all the time. The battery life on this item is really great. I've charged it once in three weeks and even then it was nowhere near empty.. Relatively quiet. </p>
<p>It works perfectly for giving yourself more frequent quick massages to loosen up than investing in full on massage sessions every now and then. Theres no need to hold a trigger so you can use it on yourself for hard to reach places.</p>
