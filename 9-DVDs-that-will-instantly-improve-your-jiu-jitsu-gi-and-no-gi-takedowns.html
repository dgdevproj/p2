<p>I really enjoyed this DVD because of its wide variety of takedowns for both grappling and MMA. Gary does a great job breaking down each technique in a way that is really easy for everyone to understand. </p>
<p>Gary has a unique approach to take downs, many of which will lead you directly into a submission attempt. Many wrestling DVDs focus on the basics of wrestling, single leg takedowns, double leg take downs and headlocks. What sets this DVD apart from others is that Gary is able to blend wrestling and judo foundational techniques directly into advanced BJJ submissions and leg locks. This is unique and not too many other DVDs offer this type of blended hybrid takedown and submission entry together. If you can master some of the techniques in this DVD you will have a unique skill set that may other competitors will not be prepared for. </p>
<p>In DVD1 Gary sets the stage by laying the foundations for his takedowns, which are largely around off balancing your opponent. By continuing to off balanace and provide feints it opens the door for your entry when the timing is right. The techniques shown here are again a blend of the basics of wrestling blended perfectly with setting traps to begin entry on the take down and submission attempts. The sections on getting behind and attacking the back is my favorite part of DVD1 and I use this technique frequently. </p>
<p>DVD2 focuses alot of attention defensive wrestling which with Russian Ties and Throw bys which allow quick attacks to the back. The single leg take downs in DVD2 also provide great entries to leg locks, which are one of Gary's main attacks. </p>
<p>DVD3 has a strong focus on attacks that lead to leg entanglements. There are some really unique and ingenious attacks in DVD3 that I have not seen in many places. The Gary Tonon shoot to kill wrestle scramble and submit set comes with 8 DVDs that are jam packed with amazing content.   </p>

<h1>Working The Cage And Walls In MMA by Benson Henderson</h1>
<p><a href="https://bjjfanatics.com/collections/daily-deals/products/working-the-cage-and-walls-in-mma-by-benson-henderson?ref="><img alt="MainProductImage" src="./images/Working The Cage And Walls In MMA by Benson Henderson.jpg" title="Check our latest prices"></a></p>
<p>Benson Henderson has always been one of my favorite MMA fights. He is a blackbelt in TaeKwon-Do and JiuJitsu. He also competes and has won against some of the very best Jiu Jitsu and submission grapplers in the world. Many MMA fighters compete in JiuJitsu and No-Gi Submission Grappling, but not too many win. Ben Henderson is a winner and can win at either sport. </p>
<p>In Benson Henderson’s DVD Working the Cage Ben focuses on the unique situation of MMA takedowns against a cage. Many of the DVDs on my list will provide the basics of wrestling, judo and jiu jitsu, but none of the other DVDs cover what happens when you or your opponent has their back against the wall. This is a unique position that only exists in MMA. Some of the more traditional Judo and Wrestling techniques will not be as affecting when your opponents back is against the wall. In some cases the opponent is actually able to dig their foot in the space between the cage and fence creating an anchor, making it double hard to perform a takedown.</p>
<p>Benson Henderson focuses on how to handle the situation with your opponent against the cage. Ben focuses on adapting the traditional wrestling takedowns to this situation to safely and efficiently get your opponent to the ground. </p>
<p>I think this DVD is obviously very important for MMA fighters. This is crucial skill and position that all fighters will find themselves in. Ben will show you many different double leg takedowns, foot sweeps and body locks. Ben also covers the Aaron Simpson body lock series that I found interesting and new.</p>
<p>This DVD will really improve the holes in your game for wrestling against the cage. A really great value and it sells for much less than other DVDs on my list. Don’t miss this one. </p>
<p>In Benson Henderson s DVD Working the Cage Ben focuses on the unique situation of MMA takedowns against a cage.

He also competes and has won against some of the very best Jiu Jitsu and submission grapplers in the world. Learn to use the cage to wrestle, trip, control, and take down your opponent with Benson s SMOOTH approach! Put the fight where YOU want by using perfect double leg positioning. Many MMA fighters compete in JiuJitsu and No-Gi Submission Grappling, but not too many win. This has everything you need to get to the next level. </p>
<p>In some cases the opponent is actually able to dig their foot in the space between the cage and fence creating an anchor, making it double hard to perform a takedown. Learn ultimate cage control from MMA Legend Benson Henderson! I ve personally seen just about every instructional video, but this one has set a new standard. This DVD will really improve the holes in your game for wrestling against the cage. Use a varied approach by incorporating the Body Lock to reduce danger and land slick foot sweeps. Ben also covers the Aaron Simpson body lock series that I found interesting and new. You will not be disappointed because this is so comprehensive. </p>
<p>He is a blackbelt in TaeKwon-Do and JiuJitsu. Please take my word on this one. Ben focuses on adapting the traditional wrestling takedowns to this situation to safely and efficiently get your opponent to the ground. This is crucial skill and position that all fighters will find themselves in. The concepts and techniques included have been proven at the highest levels of the game. </p>

A really great value and it sells for much less than other DVDs on my list. Ben will show you many different double leg takedowns, foot sweeps and body locks. The lessons on this dvd set are extremely detailed and focus on the techniques with high success ratings. </p>
<p>Benson Henderson has always been one of my favorite MMA fights. Ben Henderson is a winner and can win at either sport. Many of the DVDs on my list will provide the basics of wrestling, judo and jiu jitsu, but none of the other DVDs cover what happens when you or your opponent has their back against the wall. This is a unique position that only exists in MMA. Benson Henderson focuses on how to handle the situation with your opponent against the cage. I think this DVD is obviously very important for MMA fighters. </p>
