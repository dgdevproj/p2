<h1>BJJ - How to Defeat the Bigger Stronger Opponent with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Series 1</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BJJ-Instructional-Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu-Techniques/dp/B009PAF7L8/ref="><img alt="MainProductImage" src="./images/BJJ5DVDInstructional.jpg" title="Check our latest prices"></a></p>
<p>Set the standards in terms of audio quality video quality and presentation of material. Both Profs. The goal of this system is to strengthen stabilize and protect the joints and muscles that are most susceptible to injury...About the Actor..Emily Kwok is a Brazilian JiuJitsu blackbelt and there are at least three reasons why you should listen to her if you want to learn how to handle yourself on the mat...First of all Emily is one hell of a competitor so when she tells you that something works under pressure youd better believe her!..When she was a brown belt she competed against blackbelts at the 2007 Mundials and came away with a gold medal. I havent watched them yet but Im very disappointed with the product already. Hes a 5 time BJJ world champion and 4 time nogi ADCC champion. Secondly shes got an impeccable pedigree. I have a martial arts background but have only been studying BJJ for a few years and am always looking for ways to supplement my practice. </p>
<p>You will discover ways to connect techniques when rolling. I like Kesting a lot. Shes taken gold at the Pan Am No Gi Championships in the Absolute no weight limit division! The DVD is nicely organized into sections so it can be watched over and over with concentrations on what I may have missed or need extra work. Many people have commented that Emily has the magic touch for connecting to people breaking down and teaching techniques in a way that makes them easy to learn and quick to implement...See more. But even more importantly it includes the concepts and strategies behind the techniques which makes them more instinctive even more powerful and much easier to remember!..As you master the material itll become easier and less intimidating to fight big people. A pretty good compromise...Overall a good product and money well spent. </p>
<p>A huge amount of material is covered here providing a really great value. This will be hugely beneficial to your game. I havent watched the two discs with substantive material yet. But hes also been an absolute terror in the Absolute division regularly facing and submitting much larger worldclass opponents...Shes really taken the aspects of his game that most apply to smaller grapplers and created a system that she can now pass on to others...So in addition to all her other experience you also get the benefit of Emily reverseengineering Marcelos game for you!..Third and most importantly Emily is a born teacher. This is complemented by their respect for the traditions of the arts they have studied...The theme of the material is how to overcome a sizestrength disadvantage. Dont let guard passing turn into a battle of strength use speed leverage and timing instead!..In part 3 Emily teaches transitional escapes sharing with you the strategies and mindset that completely changed her own approach to pin escapes. She also shares specific gripfighting strategies and mindsets that have helped her win world titles in both gi and nogi grappling competitions...DVD 2 Compensating for Strength 2 hours 24 minutes..Not all guard positions keep you safe or are effective when youve facing someone who is much larger and heavier than you. and many of the students I roll with are much lightersmaller. </p>
<p>There is an incredible amount of material provided for a great value. For new students this is extremely helpful. ..Emily has learned from many of the very best instructors in the world including Marcus Soares Ricardo Almeida and Renzo Gracie. A easy or better. Plus she teaches you which sweeps work against ALL sizes of opponents...In part 2 Emily takes you through her bread and butter guard passes that she uses again and again when facing larger opponents. And a silver medal in the World NoGi Championships. Having Emily Kwok as part of the series has really inspired my teen daughter to continue to roll with adults especially males adding to her skills and selfconfidence.Very happy with my purchase. </p>
<p>KwokKesting or your own teacher too! If you are sneaky youll study up and not let you fellow students know for about six months kidding but I am sure this can help anyone improve. </p>
